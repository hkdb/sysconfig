### SUMMARY

This repo automates the setup and rollback of some of my must have shell and vim configurations on servers and desktops. This is a redacted version of my private repo to serve as a template for others in case it's useful.

### DETAILS

The install scripts determine the OS automatically and installs the following:
   - powerline (to beautify your terminal with custom colors)
   - vim configurations (monokai theme, line numbers, nerdtree, Go/Python plugins, custom shortcuts, etc)
   - mdv (a small python program that lets you preview markdown files in the terminal)
   - tilix (a terminal emulator with custom predefined layouts) - DESKTOP ONLY
   - custom bash aliases
   - [zellij](https://zellij.dev/) 

### OS SUPPORT

This script current supports the following OS's:
   - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS +
   - Debian 10 +
   - Fedora Core 31 +
   - CentOS 7+
   - Arch Linux
   - MacOS High Sierra + - <b>WIP</b>

### USAGE

Desktop Installation:

```
git clone https://github.com/hkdb/sysconfig.git
cd sysconfig/desktop
./install.sh
# Exit and Re-Login
```

Server Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/hkdb/sysconfig.git
cd sysconfig/server
./install.sh
# Exit and Re-Login
```

`Note 1:` If you get any errors for no such files, it's ok. I just didn't put in if statements to check if the files exists or not. 

`Note 2:` You may need to do a `PlugInstall` and/or `PlugUpdate` in vim after this script installs. 

To Uninstall Either Desktop or Server:
```
cd sysconfig/
./uninstall.sh
```

`Note:` uninstall.sh shreds .bash_aliases before removing the file except for Mac.

### CHANGES

Making your own changes will require you to freeze your vim plugins unless you want to deal with submodules which is another can of worms. To freeze, which essentially deletes on the .git directories in the plugin directories in .vim/plugged/, execute the following from within the desktop or server directory of this repo:

```
./freezeVIM.sh
```
### EXISTING FILES

This script does not overwrite existing files on your system but rather moves anything that's existing to `<file name>.old`

### CHANGELOG

- 10252022 - Updated install script to kdl instead yaml
- 10212022 - Added zellij config & dep for server
